Explanation of the voting system:
If you use mapvote_min=2, mapvote_need=75 and mapvote_pass=40, then a new map will be voted if:
- there are at least 2 players on the server
- 75% of all players have voted (doesn't matter for whcih map)
- 40% of all players have voted for one specific map

Why mapvote_need? simple: imagine there is a map nobody wants to play - but the people wouldn't agree about WHICH map to play instead. so if 75% of the players want another map, the map whcih got 40% of the votes will be voted - so the unwanted map is left (75% wanted this).

The other voting options do function in the same way.
