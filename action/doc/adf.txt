ADF file format information
Benjamin Greiner ("=DIE=TempFile"), 7/26/99

ADF files define location cubes for maps.

An ADF file sits inside the action/location directory and has the same name as the
corresponding map, e.g:
action/location/armyterr.adf

Inside the file each line describes a location cube in the following scheme:
<x y z> <x y z> description
Examples:
<-85.63 1290.13 -10.38> <602.00 2393.38 108.25> in the Army Base
<-113.75 132.75 6.38> <248.63 748.50 134.75> in the Terror Base

In game, some new commands help defining these cubes. For the commands to work
the server must enable cheats. It's useful to activate noclip as well :)

begincube
Allocates a temporary cube to hold the data.

setcubell
Sets the lower-left corner of the temporary cube to the calling player's current
location.

setcubeur
guess :)

addcube (description)
Sets the description of the temporary cube, copies it into the map's cube list,
saves it to file and activates it for use in game.

abortcube
Deallocates the temporary cube, thus aborting creation.

printcubestate
Prints out information about the temporary cube.

Note that all .pg support was dropped in 1.20. The addpoint command does no longer
exist.

ADF FAQ!

Q: How can I create a cube inside a cube, e.g. the tub inside a bathroom?
A: 1.20 does not support this explicitly, but since cubes are checked for
   applicability from first to last, you can "fake" this feature by defining the
   smaller cube first.
   See armyterr.adf as an example, where three nested cubes are defined in the first
   three lines.

Q: Are there map editor plugins or proxies available?
A: Not yet.
